      summary: Authenticate User
      description: >
        Authenticate a user to retrieve their identity and wallet details, enabling access to their Smart Wallet. This endpoint verifies user identity via a stamped whoami request (generated by email or passkey authentication with the SDK), authorizing them to send User Operations as a smart account owner or send transactions as a standalone EOA on Ethereum or Solana.

        If you are using the SDK to authenticate the user on the client-side, this is ideal for server-side verification. Use the SDK’s stampWhoami method on the client to generate a stamped request, then pass it to your server to call this API and confirm the user’s identity securely on your backend.
