                * `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
                * `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli**.
                * `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged. **Only available on Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli**.
                * `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.
            2. Boolean - If `true` it returns the full transaction objects, if `false` only the hashes of the transactions. Defaults to `false`.
