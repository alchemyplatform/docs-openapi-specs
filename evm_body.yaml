                      * `pending` - A sample next block built by the client on top of latest and containing the set of transactions usually taken from local mempool. Intuitively, you can think of these as blocks that have not been mined yet.
                      * `latest` - The most recent block in the canonical chain observed by the client, this block may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
                      * `safe` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is “unlikely” to be re-orged.
                      * `finalized` - The most recent crypto-economically secure block, that has been accepted by >2/3 of validators. Cannot be re-orged outside of manual intervention driven by community coordination. Intuitively, this block is very unlikely to be re-orged.
                      * `earliest` - The lowest numbered block the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first block created.

              The optional batch height descriptions are:
              * `latest` - The most recent batch in the canonical chain observed by the client, this batch may be re-orged out of the canonical chain even under healthy/normal conditions.
              * `earliest` - The lowest numbered batch the client has available. Intuitively, you can think of this as the first batch created.
